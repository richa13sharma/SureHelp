Abstract : The application is designed to make it easier for civilian volunteers to do their part in helping out during a natural disaster as well as to help leaders of organizations which deal with the aftermath of natural disasters to efficiently manage their human resources.  .

Functionality: The functionality is to make the process simple for civilian volunteers to connect with different organisations to help the people who need relief. The functions for the app are divided into two: one for the leader and one for the volunteers 

Overview of the working of the app:

For the head of the volunteer group:

1)Register on the app as a volunteer head.

2)Specify the objective and list out the tasks that need to be performed.

3)Along with the tasks, specify the number of people required for each task as well as the time within which to complete it.

4)Coordinate using in-app chat support in the case of any complications.

5)Specify if donations are accepted or not and provide necessary information for that.


For the volunteer:

1)Register on the app as a volunteer.

2)Select the group for which you want to volunteer as well as the task. If the task isn’t available, they may choose to queue up for said task while performing another.

3)After completing the task, notify on the app about the completion.

4)If the task isn’t completed within the time limit, someone else can choose to do it, unless the head has been informed and decides otherwise.

5)People can also donate money to the various groups should they choose to do so.

Benefits:

In the event of a disaster, the outpouring of support although large, is usually misguided. This app will optimize the volunteering process through effective and seamless communication as well as structured objectives.
